The Problem
===========

In this contest we will fill regular hexagonal grids[1] with positive integers so that when a cell
contains some integer k, the integers 1, 2, ..., k-1 will be among that cell's neighbors[2].
Figure 1 is an example.

    Figure 1    Figure 2

Figure 2 is the same as Figure 1, except that we've used blue to single out one cell and red for its
neighbors. Notice that, because the blue cell is 4, its neighbors include 1, 2 and 3.

[1] A hexagonal grid is a grid whose cells are regular hexagons. A regular hexagonal grid is one
    that has six sides and has the same number of cells along each side. A regular hexagonal grid
    has n^3 - (n - 1)^3 cells, where n is the number of hexagons on each side, and is said to be
    "order n".

[2] We consider two cells to be neighbors if they share a side. Interior cells, for example, have
    6 neighbors and corner cells have 3.


The Contest
===========

For each value of n from 3 through 27 submit an order n hexagonal grid as described above. Your
objective, for each n, is to maximize the sum of the grid's cells. For example, in Figure 1 the sum
of the cells is 47.

For each value of n you can submit more than one grid, but only your best grid will count.


How to Enter
===========

Paste your grids into the appropriate box on the Submit page and click Submit Entry. Format your
grids as follows:

  - Represent each row of your grid as a comma-delimited list of integers and enclose the list in
    parentheses. An order n grid has 2n - 1 rows.
  - Enter the rows as a comma-delimited list.
  - To submit more than one grid at a time, separate them with semicolons. Do not put a semicolon
    after your last grid.
  - Include spaces and line breaks anywhere you like (except within a number) to improve
    readability.

For example, if you wanted to submit the grid shown above you could enter:
(4,3,2), (2,1,3,1), (3,1,5,2,4), (2,1,4,3), (2,3,1)


The Scoring System
==================

The entrant with the highest "contest score" wins. Here's how we calculate your contest score:

  - For each of the 25 values of n, we find your best grid (that is, the one whose cells have the
    largest sum). Your "raw score" for that n is the total of the values in the grid, minus
    (3n^2 - 3n + 1). For example, for the grid shown above, the raw score is 47 - 19 = 28.
  - For each of the 25 values of n, we compute your "subscore". We do this by dividing each n's raw
    score by the highest raw score for that n across all entrants. Every subscore therefore has a
    value from 0 to 1.
  - Your contest score is the sum of your 25 subscores.

If two entrants have the same contest score, we break the tie by giving preference to the entrant
whose last improvement was submitted least recently.

Let's walk through a simplified example. Suppose we modify the contest by asking you to submit grids
for only three values of n: 3, 4 and 5. Further suppose that we have 3 entrants: Amy, Bernadette and
Penny.

We begin by summing the cell values in each submitted grid:

             n = 3    n = 4   n = 5
Amy             47      112     181
Bernadette      49      107     185
Penny           51       97     180

Next, we subtract (3n^2 - 3n + 1) from these sums to obtain raw scores:

               n = 3    n = 4   n = 5
3n^2 - 3n + 1     19       37      61

             n = 3   n = 4    n = 5
Amy             28      75      120
Bernadette      30      70      124
Penny           32      60      119

We note the highest raw score for each value of n:

                     n = 3   n = 4    n = 5
Highest Raw Score       32      75      124

Finally, we compute the subscores and contest score for each entrant:

                       n = 3             n = 4               n = 5   Contest Score
Amy           28 / 32 = .875   75 / 75 = 1.000    120 / 124 = .968   2.843
Bernadette    30 / 32 = .938    70 / 75 = .933   124 / 124 = 1.000   2.871
Penny        32 / 32 = 1.000    60 / 75 = .800    119 / 124 = .960   2.760

Bernadette has the highest contest score and therefore is the winner.
